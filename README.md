#### Welcome

This is my porfolio site [jencorbett.dev](https://jencorbett.dev), bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

As you can see, it's **very much** a work-in-progress, but here's what's currently happening with it:

- **Architecture** [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/)
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Content SDK** [ContentLayer](https://jamstack.org/)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

#### Running locally

First, switch to the app directory.
Then run the development server:

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
